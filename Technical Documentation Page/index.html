      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
  <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <code>head</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>ection</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>div</code>, <code>span</code>, <code>img</code>, <code>aside</code>, <code>audio</code>, <code>canvas</code>, <code>datalist</code>, <code>details</code>, <code>embed</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>output</code>, <code>progress</code>, <code>video</code>, <code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, <code>li</code> and many others.</p>
  <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

      <p>This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them. You should definitely start with the first one.</p>
  
      <p><h2>Introduction to HTML</h2></p>
  This module sets the stage, getting you used to important concepts and syntax, looking at applying HTML to text, how to create hyperlinks, and how to use HTML to structure a webpage.
  
      <h2>Multimedia and embedding</h2>
  This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire other webpages.
  
      <h2>HTML tables</h2>
  Representing tabular data on a webpage in an understandable, accessible way can be a challenge. This module covers basic table markup, along with more complex features such as implementing captions and summaries.

      </header>
      <p><h2>Basic structure</h2>
  The most basic application of HTML is document structure. If you're new to HTML you should start with this.
  
      <ul><li>How to create a basic HTML document</li>
    <li>How to divide a webpage into logical sections</li>
        <li>How to set up a proper structure of headings and paragraphs</li></ul>
  <h2>Basic text-level semantics</h2>
  HTML specializes in providing semantic information for a document, so HTML answers many questions you might have about how to get your message across best in your document.
      <ul>
        <li>How to create a list of items with HTML</li> 
        <li>How to stress or emphasize content</li> 
        <li>How to indicate that text is important</li> 
        <li>How to display computer code with HTML</li> 
        <li>How to annotate images and graphics</li> 
        <li>How to mark abbreviations and make them understandable</li> 
        <li>How to add quotations and citations to web pages</li> 
        <li>How to define terms with HTML</li> 
      </ul>
      <h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
  One of the main reasons for HTML is making navigation easy with hyperlinks, which can be used in many different ways:
  <ul>
    <li>How to create a hyperlin</li
    <li></ul>
    How to create a table of contents with HTML</li>
    <h2>Images & multimedia</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How to add images to a webpage</li>
    <li>How to add video content to a webpage</li></ul>
  <h2>Scripting & styling</h2>
  HTML only sets up document structure. To solve presentation issues, use CSS, or use scripting to make your page interactive.
  <ul>
    <li>How to use CSS within a webpage</l2>
  <li>How to use JavaScript within a webpage</li></ul>
  <h2>Embedded content</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How to embed a webpage within another webpage</li></ul>

    <p>Beyond the basics, HTML is very rich and offers advanced features for solving complex problems. These articles help you tackle the less common use cases you may face:
  
  Forms
  Forms are a complex HTML structure made to send data from a webpage to a web server. We encourage you to go over our full dedicated guide. Here is where you should start:
  
  How to create a simple Web form
  How to structure a Web form
  Tabular information
  Some information, called tabular data, needs to be organized into tables with columns and rows. It's one of the most complex HTML structures, and mastering it is not easy:
  
  How to create a data table
  How to make HTML tables accessible
  Data representation
  How to represent numeric and code values with HTML — see Superscript and Subscript, and Representing computer code.
  How to use data attributes
  Advanced text semantics
  How to take control of HTML line breaking
      How to mark changes (added and removed text) — see the <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code> elements.
  Advanced images & multimedia
  How to add a responsive image to a webpage
  How to add vector image to a webpage
  How to add a hit map on top of an image
  Internationalization
  HTML is not monolingual. It provides tools to handle common internationalization issues.
  
  How to add multiple languages into a single webpage
  How to display time and date with HTML

    <p><h2>Web forms</h2>
  This module provides a series of articles that will help you master the essentials of web forms. Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users — most commonly they are used for collecting data from users, or allowing them to control a user interface. However, for historical and technical reasons it's not always obvious how to use them to their full potential. We'll cover all the essential aspects of Web forms including marking up their HTML structure, styling form controls, validating form data, and submitting data to the server.
  
    <h2>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) on MDN</h2>
  The main entry point for HTML reference documentation on MDN, including detailed element and attribute references — if you want to know what attributes an element has or what values an attribute has, for example, this is a great place to start.</p><hr>
